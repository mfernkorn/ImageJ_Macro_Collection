# ImageJ_Macro_Collection
One of the many, but my very own, collection of ImageJ macros for basic processing of microscopy images.

## Macros

#### Create_Montages_v2.1.0.ijm
Creates image montages (including cingle channel images and Merge image with scale bar) from a folder of images with three channels, saved as seperate images.

#### Segmentation_and_Measurement_v2.0.ijm
2D StarDist based image segmantation including measurement of intensity and area. Loops through all images in a directory, where 3 channels are saved as seperated files.

#### Segment_and_Measure_over_time_v1.0.ijm
Similar to Segmentation_and_Measurement_v2.0.ijm. Additionally processes every n-th time frame from each stack in the directory.
